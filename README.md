# Project-4
Since I created a lot of files to test my code on, and to guarantee that the random page requests I was testing my algorithms on were the same for each (for fairness) I will upload all of the tested files. I already included in the main function of my program print statements to initialize and run what I tested.
Tester.txt --> is a file that contains 16 pages and 32 offsets
Tester2.txt --> is a file that has 32 pages and 64 offsets
The files randominputs(1 - 5) were created to test different amounts of random page requests for Tester.txt The amounts of page requests ranged from 20 - 100
The files Tester2RANDIN(1 - 5_ were created to test different amounts of random page requests for Tester2.txt. The amounts of page requests ranged from 20 -100.
